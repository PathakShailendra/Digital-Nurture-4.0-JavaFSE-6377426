#Data Structures & Algorithms (Java FSE | Deep Skilling Phase)

Welcome to the foundation of problem-solving: **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
This module builds the thinking pattern for writing **efficient, scalable, and optimal** code.

---

## 🔰 Introduction: What is DSA?

**Data Structures (DS)** are ways to organize data so that operations like search, insertion, and deletion become easy and efficient.

**Algorithms** are step-by-step instructions to solve a particular problem.

Together, DSA helps in solving real-world problems effectively using code.

## 💡 Why Learn Data Structures and Algorithms?

- 🎯 To write faster and optimized code
- 🧠 Helps you crack coding interviews (FAANG, Cognizant, TCS, etc.)
- 🚀 Forms the base of frameworks, APIs, databases, and system design
- 📈 Better performance = happier users + scalable software

## 🧱 Types of Data Structures

| Type        | Examples                             | Description |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Linear**  | Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue      | Elements are arranged sequentially |
| **Non-Linear** | Tree, Graph                        | Elements are arranged in hierarchical or interconnected fashion |
| **Hash-based** | HashMap, HashSet                   | Key-value based DS for fast lookup |
| **Advanced** | Heap, Trie, Segment Tree             | Used in competitive programming & system design |

## 📏 Time and Space Complexity

| Term        | Meaning                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | Total time an algorithm takes to run |
| **Space Complexity**| Total memory used by the algorithm   |

---

## 📊 Why Analyze Complexity?

- To choose the best approach when there are multiple ways to solve a problem.
- To understand how your code behaves on **large inputs**.

## 🧮 Asymptotic Notations (Used to express Time Complexity)

| Notation    | Meaning                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Big O (O)** | Worst-case scenario                 |
| **Omega (Ω)** | Best-case scenario                  |
| **Theta (Θ)** | Average-case or tight bound         |

### 📌 Example:

```java
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hi");
}
